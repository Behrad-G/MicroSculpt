Pore-scale Freezing Model

This is a pore-scale freezing and thawing script that I developed in R environment; the result of the script was published in the following manuscript:
Water freezing characteristics in granular soils: Insights from pore-scale simulations, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103681

Please feel free to use the script with proper citations. 

A 3D visualozation of the ice nucleation and growth is presented here:
