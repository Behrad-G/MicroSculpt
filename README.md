# MicroSculpt
**Pore-scale topology analysis model

MicroSculpt pioneers advanced 3D topology analysis and forecasting at the micro-scale, harnessing the power of the marching cube algorithm. By leveraging physics laws, this innovative solution accurately predicts freezing and thawing processes, offering invaluable insights for material science, environmental monitoring, and beyond (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103681)

A 3D visualozation of its application in environmental problems and forecasting ice nucleation and growth is presented here:
